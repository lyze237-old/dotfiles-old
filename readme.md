# Dotdrop Setup

* I have 3 profiles:
 * vbox: Virtual box installation which runs all the time whenever my pc starts.
 * mac: My works macbook.
 * sudo: For files in /etc or other directories which can only be written to with `sudo`/as root.

## vbox
My linux virtual box vm for everything linux related I do at home

## mac
Similar to wsl, this also contains a minimal installation, though a bit more compared to wsl since it includes macos specific config files. (chunkwm, skhd, ...)

## sudo
Right now only contains one file, /etc/issues, which gets installed on my home pc. 

A friend of mine made a nice greeter for me and it makes me really happy whenever I see it!
